# Distributed-Training-on-Edge-Devices

This project aims to implement a proof of concept of distributed training on edge computing devices by training and update a shared machine learning model on multiple smartphones utilizing the current state-of-the-art technologies from existing researches. This project is divided into two phases, the first phase is on the literature review and the second phase for project implementation. In the first phase of this research project, we are providing the literature review of feasibility studies on the topic to gain sufficient research on the current state of the technology, previous researches, and findings. Besides the literature review on the topic, this report also provides the technical objectives and the statement for the second phase of the project.
